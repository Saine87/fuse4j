This is still a really early version.

The maven project(s) can be built by:

cd maven
mvn install


The native executable can be built by:

cd native
make



The code is not really functional at the moment:
The native code expects the java class to implement:

fuse.FuseFS

Where as most clients will implement:

fuse.Filesystem3
