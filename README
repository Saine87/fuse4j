This is still a really early version.
The native methods are not registered yet hence more complex functionality
will not work, but you should at least be able to mount the fake filesystem.

Note: I am building on:
Mac OS X 10.5.5
Using MacFuse (Built from source)


The maven project(s) can be built by:

cd maven
mvn install


The native executable can be built by:

cd native
make


To mount the "Fake" filesystem.

cd extra
mkdir fake
./mount_fake.sh


This will mount to the "fake" directory you just created.



To run in the background (test it first in the foreground)
Edit mount_fake.sh and remove the -f flag

umount fake
./mount_fake.sh
